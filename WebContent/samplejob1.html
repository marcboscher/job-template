          stack. We’re now looking for a new developer who takes pride in his
          work to join our team and contribute to our future product
          developments.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a web-based product using the SCRUM agile
            methodology.</li>

          placement. We design, develop and manufacture everything: from
          hardware video players, to wireless access points, to SaaS web

        <ul>
          <li>We react fast, communicate a lot, and there are no politics!</li>
          <li>Developers are expected to be thinkers and designers (not
            just doers). You’re expected to be a professional, and we treat you
            as such.</li>
          <li>You’ll get to work with and learn the latest and greatest
            technologies.</li>
          <li>We’re a small and fun team, yet we’re big enough to offer job
            stability, good processes, insurance and reasonable work hours.</li>
          <li>We continuously build on our products so we keep our code
            clean and pay our technical debts.</li>
          <li>We’ve got brand new, bright and spacious offices; but we’re
            very flexible on when and where you work. We provide a laptop, a
            huge monitor and a headset.</li>

            fellows.</li>
