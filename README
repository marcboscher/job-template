Job Template 
------------

A simple HTML5 web page template for posting a job offer on the web, especially offers for web-related technical jobs.

Most job offers are files (pdf or even doc), which are fine for emailing around, but horrible for linking and viewing in browsers (especially mobile). Plus, you can't tweet a pdf. Job offers on web pages are usually just pastes of the word document: they look horrible.

In a market where hiring is very hard, a job offer must be attractive, both visually and technically. This template attempts to do just that.


Objectives
----------

- Start with the content: the job offer is the most important element, not what goes around it (technology or look and feel)
- Semantically correct: use HTML5 elements appropriately to convey semantics of content
- Clean, simple design: the look and feel must be subtle and exists only to emphasize the content
- Simple to use: creating a new job offer from the template must be quick and must not require skills beyond editing basic HTML5 markup (from a sample).
- Technically cutting edge
	- Use HTML5 and CSS3
	- Use custom fonts (Font Squirrel)
- Support all browsers, but really focus on modern HTML5 browsers (FF 6, Chrome, Safari, IE9, etc)
- Responsive design: adapt to screen size to be viewable from mobile screens to large monitors
- Lightweight: fast to load
- Printable: to pdf or printer. Page breaks must be at clean place.
- Hooks for some attitude
	- If you don't have a modern HTML5 browser, display a message: You seem to have a pretty old browser. If it's because your current employer forces you to use it, then it really is time for you to find a new job. If it's your own choice, then please don't apply for this job
- Learning project: mini-project for me to catch up on the latest technologies: HTML5, CSS3, font-embedding, github


Todo
----
- Add animation at first page load
- Add navigational aid/footer that is always visible
- switch to a grid layout that adds columns based on window width
- media query to reduce logo size based on window size. Make it work on my xperia mini!
- + share button 
- optimize: reduce number of linked file, only embed needed fonts
